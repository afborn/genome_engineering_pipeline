Jupyter notebook (gRNA_scrape_primer_design.ipynb) to receive predicted gRNAs from third-party website (check Terms of Use! This code simply demonstrates how it can be done, but does not endorse violating Terms of Use of thid-party websites) as well as primer 
design using the flanking regions around the predicted gRNAs.
