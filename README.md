# genome_engineering_pipeline
Collection of Jupyter notebooks to build a pipeline for genome-engineering using CRISPR-Cas9.
Individual notebooks serve different purposes but work together in a modular way
The first two notebooks enable to receive predicted gRNAs from third-part website as well as primer 
design using the flanking regions around the predicted gRNAs.
