# genome_engineering_pipeline
gpe_gRNA_predictions_primer_design.ipynb automates the genome-wide retrieval of predicted guide RNAs for gene-editing experiments, as well as primer design around guide RNA cut-sites. Retrieves gRNA predictions from Synthego website (check Terms of Use of third-party websites prior to using the notebook). Notebook requires gpe_module.
